## Overview

This Connect 4 game consists of the following data structures and algorithms:

### Data Structures

- Stacks implemented using arrays
- Multidimensional arrays

### Algorithms

- Stacks: Push and peek
- Multidimensional arrays: Horizontal scan, Vertical scan, and Diagonal scan
- Gameplay recursion

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `game_functions.py`: Contains the main functions and classes for the game, such as creating the game board, displaying it, handling player moves, and checking for a win.
- `main.py`: The main program that starts the game and controls the game loop.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required packages for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Connect 4 game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Change to the project directory:
3. Install dependencies:
4. Run the game:


## How to Play

1. Start the game by running `python main.py`.
2. Choose your game piece (X or O) when prompted.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the column where you want to drop your tile.
4. The first player to connect 4 tiles vertically, diagonally, or horizontally wins the game.

## Future Improvements

Several areas for potential improvements in future updates of the game:

1. **Build proper game graphics**: Enhance the game's visual appearance by designing and implementing custom graphics for the game board, pieces, and user interface.
2. **Implement ML algorithms for bot gameplay**: Improve the gameplay experience and challenge by incorporating machine learning algorithms to optimize the bot's decision-making and strategy during matches against the user.
